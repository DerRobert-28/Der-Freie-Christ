	\section{Preface}

	\subsection{Using hints}
		It may happen that I will address you,
		the reader,
		directly.
		It may also happen that,
		whenever human beings in general are mentioned,
		I will use a potentially existing masculine form.
		My intension's to create a comfortable,
		casual atmosphere,
		and to ease reading flow.
		Of course,
		my dear reader,
		totally independent of your actual gender or sex,
		I am not making any assumptions about you,
		and you will have my fullest respect.
		Since I am not a professional author,
		my writing style is not perfect,
		but rather more casual.
		And because you are reading the English version of this eBook,
		you may notice that my English is not perfect either,
		because I am not a native speaker.
		Furthermore,
		this eBook is not necessarily written in a way,
		so that one chapter builds upon the other.
		That means you do not need to read it completely,
		or \q{from A to Z},
		but you can read as much or as little as you like to,
		and in any order you prefer.
		If you are a minor,
		i.e. under 18 oder 21,
		or whatever the legal full-age of \q{your} country or state is,
		or still young and unexperienced in certain topics,
		feel free to skip them.
		If you are still interested in them,
		I recommend involving experienced or full-aged persons,
		such as your parents or other persons having parental authority.
	
	\subsection{Thank you!}
		Next I want to state my cordial thanks to you,
		my dear reader,
		that you decided to take a look into this eBook.
		Of course,
		I hope that you also will read it until the end,
		and that you will watch its development.
		I am not a 100 percent sure that it will be \q{finished} one day,
		because possibly there will always be new thoughts,
		or new material that can be included in here.
		This here is a Christian document.
		My intention is to communicate moral values to you,
		especially as they are wished by {\God}, the {\Lord},
		and {\His} {\Son} {\Jesus} {\Christ},
		by my best knowledge and conscience.
		Of course I do not want to invent a new \q{religion},
		or to re-invent Christianity,
		but rather show some new perspectives.
		As you can tell of this preface,
		words,
		which directly relate to {\God},
		{\Jesus} or also to the {\Holy} {\Spirit},
		are written in capital and bold letters.
		If something is near to your heart,
		or you have general ideas,
		I invite you sincerely,
		to participate in my  \href{https://github.com/DerRobert-28/Der-Freie-Christ/discussions}{GitHub discussion}.
	
	\subsection{Some words about myself}
		Myself was baptized catholic,
		as far as I remember correctly,
		at the age of one or two years,
		but I left church at the end of Juli 2023.
		The reasons for this are of private nature,
		and are not relevant here.
		But this has nothing to do with my belief.
		I do believe that {\God} exists,
		and that {\Jesus} is the {\Messiah}.
		Anyway,
		it does not mean that I am a kind of \q{perfect Christian},
		if such a person exists at all nowadays.
		You can read more about me in chapter \q{\hyperref[MeinLebenMitGott]{My life with {\God}}}.
	
	\newpage
	\section{What makes up a \q{Free Christian}?}
	
	\subsection{No church community}
		A Free Christian is not bound to a church community.
		That means,
		you can,
		but you do not have to be baptized.
		You can also have left your church.
		That does not play a role at all.
		In my opinion,
		it is even more sensible,
		to not be a member of a church community at all,
		especially of the catholic one,
		to not be manipulated by it.
		The only important thing is,
		to let {\God},
		the {\Lord},
		and {\Jesus} {\Christ} come into your life,
		and that you confess yourself to {\Them}.
	
	\subsection{The true bond}
		For you,
		as a Free Christian,
		the only true,
		existing bond is between {\God},
		{\Jesus} {\Christ} and you.
		When you confess yourself to {\Them},
		you cherish your relationship sincerely.
		Mundane bonds \textit{(relationships)} are ephemeral,
		although it is not less important,
		to also cherish them warmly.
			
	\subsection{The Bible as a \q{tool}}
		If it serves the relationship between {\God},
		{\Jesus} and you,
		you have,
		as a Free Christian,
		the freedom to interpet biblical passages better,
		that means more modern or more understandable,
		and rephrase them accordingly.
		But this is \textbf{not a} \q{licence},
		to rewrite the Word of {\God} by free convenience,
		and then for example to bend {\His} will,
		as it was done willingly in the past by the catholic church,
		according to my information and my research.
		
	\subsection{Belief and science}
		Belief and science are,
		in my opinion,
		not mutually exclusive.
		No,
		quite the opposite:
		The more we get to learn about our universe,
		is it then not amazing,
		what a great work {\God} has accomplished?
		And {\God} {\Himself} can neither be proven,
		nor refuted.
		You always have free choice,
		whether you want to live with {\God},
		or not.
		That is,
		why you as a human being have been given free will.

	\subsection{What do I know about {\God}?}
		Well ... what does one actually \q{know} about {\God}?
		Sure,
		I can get to know,
		and learn more about {\God} and {\Jesus} by {\His} Holy Word,
		the Bible.
		But I never would arrogate to claim to \q{know} {\God}.
		Even less absolutely.
		Only {\God} {\Himself} knows {\Himself} completely.
		And with this eBook I only want to share my experience with you.
		And what I tell about {\God},
		is only according to my best knowledge and conscience,
		and only in {\His} favour.
		
	\newpage
	\section{Do you (not) believe in {\God}?}
		Although this eBook is a Christian document,
		it does not mean that only Christians are \q{allowed} to read it.
		Quite the opposite!
		Even if you believe in something different,
		or nothing at all,
		you are invited sincerely to browse into here.
		{\God} loves us all equally.
		But ... what do you actually believe in?

	\subsection{\q{I am a Jew and do not believe in {\Jesus} as {\Messiah}.}}
		Nevertheless,
		you are invited sincerely,
		to keep on reading.
		Effectively,
		we believe in the same {\God},
		who is also called {\Elohim} or {\Yahweh} in the Holy Scriptures.
		According to my knowledge,
		big parts of your holy book,
		e.g. the Torah,
		are congruent with the Old Testament of the Bible.
		For example I will mention the Genesis,
		or the Exodus (of Egypt).
		Because I already admitted that I do not claim to know {\God},
		I also would not claim that you are a bad person,
		because you do not believe in {\Jesus},
		and for this you might not come to {\Heaven}.
		If you do not acknowledge {\Jesus} as your {\Messiah},
		I will accept this.
		I also ask you to accept that for me {\Jesus} \textbf{is} the {\Messiah}.
		It is not about forcing you onto {\Jesus},
		but to show you moral values in the whole,
		and to share my experience to you.
		
	\subsection{\q{I am a Muslim and believe in Allah.}}
		Then you are also invited sincerely,
		to continue reading.
		I have already admitted
		that I do not presume to know {\God}.
		That is why I do not know,
		whether (the) {\God} that I believe in,
		and your god,
		Allah,
		are effectively the same god,
		or two different ones,
		and therefore setting them equal would be blasphemy.
		I will not deny your belief.
		You can pray to Allah,
		and see him as your only god.
		If you consider me a heathen or a nonbeliever,
		I take that as your opinion.
		I accept that Allah is your only god for you.
		I ask you,
		to accept that {\God} is my only god for me.
		I still hope that outside of our belief,
		just from a human perspective,
		we can respect each other.
		After all,
		I do not want to impose another god on you,
		but just show you some moral values in the whole,
		and to share my experiences to you.
	
	\subsection{\q{I belong to a different religion.}}
		Unfortunately I cannot get into every orientation of belief,
		religion, cult or sect of this world.
		This would go beyond the scope of this eBook.
		So I beg your pardon,
		if I did not explicitly mention your belief.
		If you read the two paragraphs above,
		and if it may be the case that you come to the conclusion,
		according to your belief,
		I am a heathen or a nonbeliever,
		then I accept this as your opinion.
		I accept that the god(s),
		the goddess(es),
		or even if it may be the devil,
		are those,
		who are worth to be praised or worshipped.
		I also ask you,
		to accept that for me,
		{\God} is my only god.
		I still hope that outside of our belief,
		just from a human perspective,
		we can respect each other.
		After all,
		I do not want to impose \q{my} {\God} on you,
		but just show you some moral values in the whole,
		and to share my experiences to you.
		
	\subsection{\q{I do not believe in a god, or I am agnostic.}}
		You,
		too,
		are invited sincerely to go on reading.
		Although if you,
		my friend,
		do not believe in {\God} (anymore),
		or you do not care or know about the existence of something divine,
		you do have some kind of moral values.
		Would you like to be hurt or killed just like that?
		Would you like to be stolen from or betrayed?
		Would you like to be cheated by your partner,
		if you do not have something like a so-called open relationship?
		Would you be like to be lied to?
		Would you not also like to have a healthy body,
		and enjoy a high quality of living?
		Would you not just be loved as you are,
		deep inside of you?
		Thus I accept,
		if you do not have the need of a god in your life.
		Although I ask you,
		to accept that for me {\God} exists,
		and {\He} is the only {\God}.
		I hope that just from a human perspective,
		we can respect each other.
		After all,
		I do not want to impose a god or a belief on you,
		but just show you some moral values in the whole,
		and to share my experiences to you.
		
	\subsection{\q{I want to believe in {\God} (again).}}
		Have you strayed from or lost your belief?
		Regardless of any of the above mentioned (religious) beliefs,
		perhaps this eBook can help you find (or rediscover) {\God},
		and maybe even accept {\Jesus} as your {\Saviour}.
		It might also assist you in reconsidering your moral values,
		and engaging in self-reflection.
		Even then,
		it would bring me joy.

	\subsection{Summary}
		So,
		no matter what you believe,
		want to believe,
		or do not,
		you are warmly invited to read.
		I am not imposing anything on you.
		Your belief or non-belief is just as valid and right as mine.
		What matters to me is that you feel comfortable here.
		Therefore,
		as mentioned earlier,
		feel free to read this eBook in (almost) any order,
		or skip specific topics if or when you feel uncomfortable.
		You are \underline{valuable} as a \underline{human being},
		and you are \underline{lovable},
		regardless of your (non-)belief!
		
	\newpage
	\section{Who and how is {\God}?}
		This chapter also serves me,
		so I can do some Bible study.
		It is about,
		how {\God} is called in the Bible,
		i.e. {\His} names and general designations,
		and how {\He} manifests {\Himself}.
		Of course,
		this also includes {\Jesus} and the {\Holy} {\Spirit}.
		I will provide a list below:
		which is usually in the style \q{{\He} is ...},
		or \q{{\He} is called ...},
		and then who or how {\God} is.
		Additionally I want to share Bible passages with you,
		which I think,
		are especially mentionable,
		because they are very beautiful,
		because they are very intense,
		or because I find them somehow interesting.
		And if I have a source,
		i will put in brackets the first Bible passage,
		where that appears.
		I will use the English Standard Version as a translation.
		Have fun discovering {\God} together.

					\textit{(Luke 20, 16-17)}
		\end{itemize}

	\newpage
	\section{The Ten Commandments}
		The traditional 10 commandments are usually handed down from the viewpoint of {\God},
		that means in the form of \q{Thou shalt (not) ...},
		or more modern \q{You shall (not) ...}.
		Below are the 10 commandments from your own viewpoint,
		as if yourself would talk to {\God},
		and make them a promise to {\Him}.
		They are also worked out a bit better,
		because on closer consideration,
		some commandments can be summarized.
		Of course,
		that does not mean that I refuse,
		or decline the traditional {\God} given commandments.
		I just want to show another perspective.
		In addition I will call them \q{offers},
		to emphasize the good will of both sides.
	
	\subsection{The Highest Offer}
		The Highest Offer is:
		I will love and praise {\God},
		the {\Lord},
		sincerely with all of my heart.
		And I will love my neighbour,
		as I also do myself.
		
	\subsubsection{The First Offer}
		{\Thou} art the {\Lord},
		my {\God},
		my {\Saviour}.
		I will not have other gods before or besides {\Thee},
		and I will not praise or worship them.
		And I will neither create an idol nor a graven image
		\textit{(nor a picture of {\God})}.
		
	\subsubsection{The Second Offer}
		{\Thou} art the {\Lord},
		my {\God}.
		I will not misuse {\Thy} name.
		I will not slander or blaspheme against {\Thee}.
		And I will confess myself honestly to {\Thee}.
		\\
		\textit{Short hint:
		This should also include colloquial phrases,
		such as \q{Oh (my) G...},
		or \q{For G...'s sake},
		that you say quickly,
		but without really meaning {\God} {\Himself},
		or to pray to {\Him},
		or something similar.}
			
	\subsubsection{The Third Offer}
		{\Thou} art the {\Lord},
		my {\God}.
		I will not put {\Thee} to the test.
		I will not try {\Thee}.
		Also in need I will confess myself to {\Thee}.
		\\
		\textit{Short hint:
		This is also intended to cover situations,
		in which one carelessly says such things as,
		for example,
		how {\God} can allow this or that suffering.}
		
	\subsubsection{The Fourth Offer}
		{\Thou} art the {\Lord},
		my {\God}.
		I will sanctify and keep the Sabbath to {\Thee}.
		On Sabbath I will stay abstinent of fleshly
		and addictive things.
		
	\subsubsection{The Fifth Offer}
		I will honour my father and my mother,
		who gave my life to me,
		and raised and nourished me.
		And I will honour Elder People.
			
	\subsubsection{The Sixth Offer} \label{TheSixthOffer}
		I will not kill or murder.
		I will cherish my relationships.
		I will respect life and the wellbeing of all living beings,
		and I will protect them as far as possible.
		\\
		\textit{Short hint:
		The killing here is not just literal,
		meaning physically,
		but also symbolic,
		for example,
		by saying something to someone out of anger,
		what hurts him,
		and thus damages the relationship.
		Feel free to read the Bible passage \href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/MAT.5/Matthew-5}{Matthew 5, 21-26}.}
		
	\subsubsection{The Seventh Offer}
		I will not commit adultery.
		I will not covet my neighbour's woman or wife.
		I will not covet my neighbour's man or husband.
		
	\subsubsection{The Eighth Offer}
		I will not steal or betray.
		I will not rob or kidnap.
		I will not covet my neightbour's house.
		I will not covet my neightbour's belongings.
		I will not cause harm to my neighbour's belongings.
		
	\subsubsection{The Ninth Offer} \label{TheNinthOffer}
		I will not bear false witness against my neighbour.
		I will not lie or betray.
		I will not swear.
		I will act honestly and fairly against my neightbour.
		\\
		\textit{Short hint:
		The word \q{swear} here is ambiguous.
		Since it can be understood as \q{(to) swear an oath},
		or \q{(to) curse}.
		So the sentence could also be written down as
		\q{I will not swear an oath, and I will not summon or curse.}}
		
	\subsubsection{The Tenth Offer} \label{TheTenthOffer}
		My body is a gift, a present, of {\Thine},
		and therefore it is holy.
		I will honour and cherish it.
	
	\subsection{Comparison}
		In Judaism the 10 commandments,
		which are called \q{10 words that {\God} spoke} in the Torah,
		are traditionally handed down,
		so that you can compare two of each on the commandment boards,
		and establish a connection in the broadest sense.
		For example the first commandment is:
		\q{Thou wilt recognize {\God} as {\Lord} and deliverer \textit{(liberator)} from Egypt.}
		And the sixth one as parallel connection is:
		\q{Thou wilt not kill or murder.}
		Of course,
		this means that you do neither cause physical,
		nor psychological harm to your fellow human being,
		for example due to an insult,
		as already explained in \q{\hyperref[TheSixthOffer]{The Sixth Offer}}.
		The parallel connection here is,
		to accept {\God} totally with the first commandment,
		and to accept your fellow one totally with the sixth commandment.
		So,
		in both cases,
		it is about unconditional love,
		once towards {\God},
		and once towards your fellow human being.
		The \textbf{10 Offers} are also cabable to be compared to each other,
		and I will show you the parallels:
		\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\textbf{The 1st and the 6th Offer:}
			\\		On one hand {\God},
					and on the other hand your fellow human being,
					shall be accepted totally.
					So it is about unconditional love towards {\God},
					and towards your neighbour.
					Furthermore to having other gods,
					either besides or before {\God},
					you cause harm to your relationship to {\God}.
					Additionally,
					you cause harm to your fellow,
					e.g. by killing him or her.
			\item	\textbf{The 2nd and the 7th Offer:}
			\\		Here the connection is a bit deeper.
					Of course,
					on the one hand towards {\God}.
					And on the other hand towards your spouse,
					but also towards another married fellow.
					In our modern times,
					where you do not marry immediately or early,
					adultery can also be enlarged onto every romantic relationship,
					in the sense of \q{cheating},
					or generally harming a (romantic) relationship.
					Eventually it is a matter of deep and intimate respect.
					The meaning is,
					one the one hand,
					if you misuse the name of {\God},
					it is very disrespectful against {\Him},
					and this causes great harm to a deep relationship with {\God}.
					And,
					on the other hand,
					if you commit adultery,
					if you cheat,
					or some much,
					then this is very disrespectful towards your fellow human being.
					Simultaneous it is a breach of trust.
					For example,
					you are married,
					and you are getting intimate with a person outside of your relationship,
					how will your spouse know that you will never do this again?
					Or the other way around:
					How would you feel?
					Would you want this to happen to you?
					\textit{Annotation:
					This is not about so-called
					loose or open relationships.
					I do not want to make it unnecessarily complex.}
			\item	\textbf{The 3rd and the 8th Offer:}
			\\		The connection in the trial of {\God},
					and in theft is that on the one hand,
					you want to steal,
					in a symbolic way,
					a part of {\Gods} omnipotence.
					Let me show you a very extreme example:
					Let's say,
					you are jumping out of the window,
					and you are saying something like:
					\q{If {\God} exists, {\He} will catch me.}
					With this action you would \q{steal} of {\His} almightiness.
					And on the other hand,
					towards your fellow human being,
					it should be clear that you do not take away of him without justification,
					i.e. actual theft,
					but also you shall not claim services without justification:
					\q{theft of service},
					usually called \q{betrayal}.
			\item	\textbf{The 4th and the 9th Offer:}
			\\		The parallel connection here is that there are certain things,
					which are called holy,
					and thus they shall be treated honourably.
					On the one hand,
					it is Sabbath,
					the \textbf{seventh} day,
					because {\God} rested at the \textbf{seventh} day after {\His} creation.
					This is why in our society Sunday,
					the \textbf{seventh} day of the week,
					is neither a workday nor a business day in many companies or (industrial) branches.
					On the other hand,
					everything you communicate shall be holy or honourable.
					Thus you shall tell the truth,
					and you shall be fair towards your neighbour.
					Additionally,
					what I recently mentioned with \q{\hyperref[TheNinthOffer]{The Ninth Offer}},
					\q{swearing} can also refer to \q{cursing} or \q{summoning},
					and those are anything else but honourable and holy.
			\item	\textbf{The 5th and the 10th Offer:}
			\\		Here the connection is much more than obvious,
					in my opinion.
					Your \textit{biological} parents gave life to you,
					and normally they raised and nourished you.
					Of course,
					it may be the case that you have adoptive parents,
					or there are completely different circumstances.
					But,
					without any doubt,
					there are two human beings that procreated and gave birth to you.
					And both gave your life to you.
					And even when,
					in an extreme case,
					you may not know your natural parents,
					you have a body.
					And you only have this one earthly life.
					And thus it is important that you care for yourself.
					And even when I said \q{body},
					it is also about your thoughts,
					your soul,
					your mind,
					your character,
					which can be found in your brain.
					which effectively again is a part of your body.
					Always mind,
					what comes from the outside into your inside,
					All of physical,
					mental and spiritual nourishment \textit{(food)}.
					It is less important,
					how long you live.
					More important is the quality of your lifetime.
					It should be as high as possible,
					and that you feel good.
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsection{Summary}
		Shortened the 10 offers can be summarized as following:

	\section{Virtues and (Capital) Sins}
		In the following,
		I want to delve into the Seven Virtues,
		and the Seven Capital Sins,
		also known as Deadly Sins.
		I have made sure to choose alternative names whenever possible.
		However,
		it may well be that they are officially called differently.
	
	\subsection{The Seven Virtues}
	
	\subsubsection{The First Virtue}
		\textbf{The first virtue is devotion,
		humility,
		modesty and will to serve.}
		So in general,
		be ready to serve your neighbour,
		without expecting anything in return.
		I know that it is difficult in our society,
		to always implement this,
		since you need a job,
		in order to finance your life with your salary.
		But between friends,
		for example,
		you do not always have to hope for something in return.

	\subsubsection{The Second Virtue}
		\textbf{The second virtue is benevolence.
		charity,
		dearness,
		love (of your neighbour) and respect.}
		Appreciate your fellow human beings,
		love and respect them.
		For example, everyone has difficult times,
		so stand by them with love and goodwill.
	
	\subsubsection{The Third Virtue}
		\textbf{The third virtue is abstinence,
		chastity,
		moderation and renunciation of instincts.}
		Especially if you want to keep the Sabbath,
		you stay away from alcohol, for example,
		or other intoxicating substances.
		But also outside the Sabbath,
		is it not nicer to live out your urges with your partner,
		the one you love,
		instead of having different partners every day?
		Is the last one not too stressful?

	\subsubsection{The Fourth Virtue}
		\textbf{The fourth virtue is constancy,
		fortitude,
		hope,
		patience and serenity.}
		And yes,
		this is exactly where I could tell myself:
		\q{Look who's talking!}
		This is,
		where I can work on myself,
		because if something does not work,
		and again,
		and again,
		I quickly lose my patience.
		So,
		let us work on it together!

	\subsubsection{The Fifth Virtue}
		\textbf{The fifth virtue is measure and moderation.}
		Of everything you can have or want,
		it does not always have to be that much.
		If you crave chocolate,
		is a piece not just enough,
		instead of a whole bar?
		If you feel like wine,
		is a glass not enough,
		instead of a whole bottle?
		When you eat your meal,
		is it not enough to eat until you are full,
		instead of cramming everything into yourself,
		main issue of having eaten all up?

	\subsubsection{The Sixth Virtue}
		\textbf{The sixth virtue is benevolence,
		empathy,
		favour,
		goodwill,
		gratitude,
		openness,
		solidarity and sympathy.}
		Even in difficult times,
		and especially afterwards,
		you may be grateful.
		After all, you have overcome them.
		You have been given a whole life full of possibilities,
		for which you may be grateful.
		And pass on this gratitude to your fellow human beings.
		It makes you likable,
		and helps you towards mutual openness and goodwill.
	
	\subsubsection{The Seventh Virtue}
		\textbf{The seventh virtue is determination,
		diligence,
		enthusiasm and zeal.}
		By \q{struggle},
		of course,
		it does not refer to a real fight or dispute.
		It is more in a symbolic sense.
		Work diligently on something,
		and stick with it,
		even when it gets tough sometimes.
		You are allowed to take breaks,
		to recover and gather new energy.

	\subsection{The Seven Capital Sins}

	\subsubsection{The First Capital Sin}
		\textbf{The first capital sin is arrogance,
		hubris,
		pride and vanity.}
		This does not mean that you cannot be proud of anything anymore.
		It is more about that some people are proud of the wrong things,
		things they have not done anything for,
		e.g. their nationality,
		and then even boast about it,
		to adorn themselves with it.
		Let yourself be praised for a good performance,
		but do not shout it from the rooftops!

	\subsubsection{The Second Capital Sin}
		\textbf{The second capital sin is avarice,
		covetousness and greed.}
		It is okay to have money.
		In our modern society,
		one cannot do without it anymore.
		But be completely honest with yourself:
		Do you really need millions and millions in your account?
		Or how much do you really need for a reasonable standard of living,
		which still allows more than just survival?
		And if you have something to spare,
		be ready to share it with your neighbour!
	
	\subsubsection{The Third Capital Sin}
		\textbf{The third capital sin is desire,
		extravagance,
		hedonism,
		lewdness and lust.}
		Do you really need that for yourself,
		for example,
		binge-drinking every weekend?
		Do you need a different person in your bed every day?
		Would it not be much nicer to feel secure in a safe harbour?
		
	\subsubsection{The Fourth Capital Sin}
		\textbf{The fourth captial sin is anger,
		impatience,
		irritation,
		vindictiveness and wrath.}
		If someone or something has hurt you,
		it is okay to allow the emotions.
		Feel them,
		but do not take them out on your neighbour!
		Let them know and withdraw instead.
		One can practice developing a certain emotional intelligence.
		But when youare angry,
		it already was and is within you,
		and your fellow human beings are not to blame for it!

	\subsubsection{The Fifth Capital Sin}
		\textbf{The fifth capital sin is excess,
		gluttony,
		immoderation,
		overeating and self-indulgence.}
		Is it not enough to eat until you are satisfied?
		Does it have to be a huge,
		overflowing plate?
		Does quantity really have to triumph over quality?
		And if you have something to spare,
		you can gladly share it!
	
	\subsubsection{The Sixth Capital Sin}
		\textbf{The sixth capital sin is coveting,
		envy and jealousy.}
		So your neighbour does not deserve to have something, too?
		Why not?
		Are you not capable of earning it for yourself?
		Or what lies behind your envy?

	\subsubsection{The Seventh Capital Sin}
		\textbf{The seventh capital sin is apathy
		cowardice,
		ignorance,
		inertia and laziness.}
		Do not confuse it with taking a break!
		If you are exhausted from your work,
		then rest until you have the energy to work again.
		But is it not,
		for example,
		unfair to sit at home,
		get paid by the state,
		and be just supported by others?
		
	\subsection{Comparison}
		The Virtues and Sins be contrasted or opposed as follows:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Humility $\Longleftrightarrow$ Vanity}
			\item \textbf{Benevolence $\Longleftrightarrow$ Greed}
			\item \textbf{Chastity $\Longleftrightarrow$ Lust}
			\item \textbf{Serenity $\Longleftrightarrow$ Wrath}
			\item \textbf{Moderation $\Longleftrightarrow$ Gluttony}
			\item \textbf{Gratitude $\Longleftrightarrow$ Envy}
			\item \textbf{Diligence $\Longleftrightarrow$ Laziness}
		\end{enumerate}

	\newpage
	\section{Will I go to {\Heaven}?}
	
	\subsection{Completely in general}
		Whether we go to {\Heaven} ultimately lies completely with {\God} {\Himself}.
		I do not want to presume here to claim,
		how we might be punished for any sins.
		I rather believe that once we possibly have to justify our actions.
		I am not saying that we are actually \q{punished},
		and I am only saying \q{possibly}.
		I do hope that {\God} is kind and mercifully forgiving us our sins.
		It is not about whether you,
		dear reader,
		believe in {\Jesus} specifically right now or not.
		But we ourselves cannot free ourselves from our sins,
		because what we have done,
		we have done.
		It cannot simply be undone.

	\subsection{We are all sinners}
		I would like to revisit {\Gods} commandments \textit{(offers)},
		and the seven virtues and capital sins.
		Feel free to be honest with yourself.
		\\
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
			\item	Have you,
					in the broadest sense,
					ever worshiped or praised another \q{God},
					even in a symbolic sense?
					This includes \q{idolizing} people and things.
			\item	Have you ever imagined what {\God} might look like?
					This is also called creating an idol or image of {\God}.
			\item	Have you never used one of those typical colloquial phrases,
					like \qq{Oh (my) G...},
					outside of a prayer,
					without referring to {\God},
					just because it is \q{what people say}?
					You could also say something like
					\qq{Oh, my goodness.}
			\item	Have you never,
					out of despair or other reasons,
					thought or even said something like
					\qq{How can {\God} allow such suffering?}
			\item	Are holidays really holy or sacred to you,
					or do you \q{celebrate} them just for the sake of commerce?
					Just make sure to find a nice Easter nest on Easter,
					and make sure to get a nice gift on Christmas?
			\item	Have you ever been disrespectful to your parents,
					either directly or indirectly?
					Have you cursed your parents?
					Could it be that they are doing their best,
					and it has sometimes been your fault,
					or entirely different circumstances,
					over which your parents have no control?
			\item	Do you take care of your relationships enough?
					And by that,
					I do not just mean the relationship with your (spouse) partner.
					I mean any interpersonal relationship:
					your parents,
					your children (if you have any),
					your friends,
					your colleagues, and so on.
			\item	Have you ever killed or even murdered?
					Are you possibly a soldier or similar?
					If so,
					who are you to take it upon yourself,
					to decide about the life or rather the death of your \q{enemy}?
			\item	Have you ever insulted or offended someone?
					For example,
					in traffic,
					have you shouted \qq{Idiot} at someone who cut you off?
			\item	Have you ever killed an insect,
					like a fly,
					or other small creature,
					just because it was annoying?
			\item	Have you ever cheated?
					If not,
					have you at least looked at another man or woman,
					because you found them attractive?
			\item	And now,
					more concretely,
					what is your stance on pornography,
					especially if you are in a relationship?
					What would you think of your partner,
					if he or she consumed such content?
			\item	Have you ever taken something away from someone?
					Here,
					too,
					if you are a father,
					mother or teacher:
					have you ever temporarily taken something away from your son,
					daughter or student,
					because he (or she) was "naughty"?
					Even children have the right to property.
					So who are you,
					to take something away from him or her?
			\item	Have you ever been jealous,
					because someone had something you would have liked?
					Why do you not wish him that?
			\item	Have you ever lied?
					Even if you consider yourself a (relatively) honest person,
					what do you say when someone asks you
					\qq{How are you?}
					Do you just say \qq{Fine.},
					out of politeness,
					to not burden your counterpart,
					when in reality you feel terrible?
			\item	Do you curse when you lose patience?
					Or do you generally use many swear words,
					no matter the context?
			\item	Do you always need the latest technical device,
					be it a smartphone,
					a smartwatch,
					or whatever,
					just to impress your neighbour?
					Do you really need that?
			\item	Is everything with you just an eternal give-and-take?
					Or can you also do something,
					without immediately expecting something in return?
			\item	Do you respect your fellow human beings?
					Or do you often jump to premature conclusions?
					You do not have to find everyone likable,
					but every person has their own life story.
					Do not judge anyone,
					unless you have walked in their \q{shoes} for at least a day!
			\item	How often have you just had one or two glasses of beer,
					or wine,
					too many?
					Why do you need that?
					So that you feel terrible the next day?
			\item	Do you need someone different in your bed every day?
			\item	Are you very patient,
					or do you easily lose your temper?
			\item	When eating,
					do you always finish everything,
					just because it was taught to you as a child,
					even if you are already full?
					Or can you moderate yourself,
					and put less on your plate from the start?
			\item	Are you grateful for your body?
					Do you fundamentally accept it?
					Or are you harming it,
					for example,
					with smoking or other vices?
			\item	Are you generally grateful for your life,
					or do you have something to complain about everything?
					Remember what you have accomplished and overcome to get this far!
			\item	Will you stick it out to the end?
					Do you complete your projects to the end,
					or do you give up halfway?
			\item	Are you proud to belong to a particular nation,
					to be a man or a woman,
					a child,
					an adult,
					or whatever you have no control over?
					It is okay to be proud of your own achievements.
					But what have you done to,
					for example,
					be born as a man?
			\item	Do you keep everything for yourself and give nothing away?
					Do you need everything for yourself alone?
					Especially when it comes to money?
					Do you not perhaps have one or two \q{pennies} left,
					to help your fellow human beings?
			\item	Are you constantly angry at your fellow human beings,
					without limits?
					Do you always think that you cannot forgive them,
					no matter what happened?
					\\
		\end{itemize}
		I could think of much more for sure,
		but that would surely go beyonod the scope.
		And yes,
		I must also take a look at myself!
		
		
	\subsection{What can I do?}
		Like I already mentioned,
		you did what you did.
		And you can do nothing to make it undone.
		Both your good actions,
		and also your bad ones.
		Both your achievements,
		and also your \q{failures}.
		You cannot do anything on your own,
		to \q{please} {\God}.
		You can only accept {\His} gift,
		{\His} grace,
		{\His} mercy.
		If you decide for a living with {\God},
		and you accept {\Jesus} as your {\Saviour},
		then you also accept {\Gods} gift.
		Feel free to read the following Bible verses:
		\href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/JHN.14/John-14}{John 14, 6},
		\href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/ACT.4/Acts-4}{Act 4, 12},
		\href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/ROM.3/Romans-3}{Romans 3, 23-24},
		\href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/GAL.2}{Galatians 2, 16} and \href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/EPH.2/Ephesians-2}{Ephesians 2, 8-9}.
		\\
		\textit{And now, the following is VERY important:}
		You \textbf{may} still keep {\Gods} commandments \textit{(offers)},
		but make sure what motive is behind it!
		If you only keep them,
		hoping to get into {\Heaven},
		you have misunderstood it.
		But the mistake is not yours.
		Unfortunately,
		we live in a world of constant give and take.
		A simple example:
		You go to work every day,
		and at the end of the month,
		you get paid for it.
		Then you pay your rent so you can continue living in your apartment.
		You pay for electricity and gas,
		so you have light,
		and do not freeze in winter.
		And you buy groceries,
		so you will not starve.
		Always a service for a service in return.
		Our society just works that way.
		And we wrongly transfer that to {\God}.
		But {\God} gives you {\His} grace and goodness,
		because {\He} loves you.
		Just as you are.
		You do not have to do anything,
		absolutely nothing for it.
		But we all think
		- and I am no exception
		- that for some reason,
		we are not worth being loved by {\God},
		because we sin continuously.
		A little (emergency) lie here,
		insulting someone out of anger there.
		And then we think we are unloved.
		But there is good news:
		{\Jesus} died for you and your sins on the cross.
		The only thing you \q{need} to do,
		is let {\Him} into your life,
		open your heart to {\Him}.
		Because {\He} loves you unconditionally.
		And that is exactly how you should act.
		If you want to keep {\Gods} commandments,
		not \q{so that} you get into {\Heaven}.
		No,
		simply out of gratitude,
		because {\God},
		because {\Jesus} made this huge sacrifice that no one could ever make up for.
		Do not keep {\His} commandments,
		and then demand or expect to get into heaven!
		Also,
		pay attention to the following:
		Not,
		\q{if} you love {\God},
		you keep {\His} commandments,
		but \q{because} you love {\Him}.
		But you also should not rest on it,
		by saying something like:
		\q{Well,
		{\Jesus} died for me anyway,
		now I can sin endlessly.}
		That would also be selfish in relation to the relationship with {\God}.
		It might be difficult to distinguish all that.
		But at least pay attention,
		to why you consciously want to keep {Gods} commandments.
		Do you do it willingly,
		out of gratitude to {\Jesus}?
		Or are you hoping for \q{a piece of heaven}?
		
	\subsection{Summary}
		Therefore,
		I can only say that I hope for {\Gods} grace and goodness.
		I hope that if we are serious about {\Him},
		and we walk {\His} path,
		fulfill {\His} will,
		then {\God} will also show mercy.
		And by \q{{\His} will},
		I do not mean that we are submissive or weak-willed puppets.
		After all,
		{\God} gave us all our own will,
		out of {\His} goodness.
		That means,
		we can decide for ourselves,
		whether we want to live with {\Him} or not.
		It simply means that we follow {\His} commandments,
		and treat each other honestly and lovingly.

	\newpage
	\section{Examining different sins in detail}
		In this chapter,
		I want to take a closer look at some sins.
		Some of them may be committed consciously,
		some unconsciously,
		some are hard to avoid,
		and so on.
		I want to show you that life is not always black-and-white.
		There is often not just \q{good} and \q{evil}.
		Sometimes,
		there are grey areas.
		And I am sure that is,
		how {\God} sees it,
		too.
		That is,
		why {\He} gave us free will,
		so we can make our own decisions.
		So that we can have our own experiences,
		and learn from them.

	\subsection{About breaking the Sabbath}
		What is breaking the Sabbath?
		Actually it is simple:
		On the Seventh Day of {\His} creation {\God} rested,
		and so {\His} commandment to us human beings is to rest,
		too,
		at the seventh day of the week.
		This is where our seven weekdays come from,
		where on Sundays many branches and companys do not work.
		But even with this topic:
		There is no distinct black-and-white-pattern,
		it depends on different things.
		So,
		in the following I will work it out in detail.
	
	\subsubsection{What about other holidays?}
		There are other days,
		too,
		which can be considered holidays,
		where you should also rest.
		Many of them are mainly influenced religiously ,
		so,
		as a Free Christian,
		I will not elaborate on them.
		As of October 2023 I am not well-versed enough in the Bible,
		to tell,
		which days besides Sabbath are also worthy as a holiday
		or a memorial day,
		except of the following:
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
			\item the Birth of {\Jesus} {\Christ}
			\item the Last Supper
			\item the Crucifixion of {\Jesus} {\Christ}
			\item the Resurrection of {\Jesus} {\Christ} (of the dead)
			\item the Ascension of {\Jesus} {\Christ}
		\end{itemize}
		The little \q{problem} with holidays and memorial days is that no specific dates are known,
		and some of them are simply determined by the catholic church,
		so that one has specific holidays during the year.
		That does not mean that I disapprove of it,
		just because I say that the church has determined them.
		In this case,
		it is even perfectly fine that the church,
		due to ignorance,
		has defined a few days a year in honour of {\Jesus}.
		To put it somewhat casually:
		This whole thing happened about two millennia ago,
		and I do not know
		who back then,
		what and how exactly documented it.

	\subsubsection{\q{I also work on Sundays in my company.}}
		You would like to know,
		if it is sin,
		to be working where you work?
		In my opinion there too major factors that play a role:
		The first one is the motivation.
		Do you just and exclusivly work to earn money?
		And I am not saying that in our society you have to finance your living,
		but your very personal motivation.
		If you only work for money,
		then it is definitely a sin,
		and it does not matter,
		what you work.
		But,
		if it is not only the money you work for,
		then there are many jobs and occupations,
		which are totally fine in my opinion.
		Namely it is jobs/occupations where you care about other humans;
		specific examples could be
		caregiver,
		(geriatric) nurse,
		or a paramedic.
		Because even {\Jesus} e.g. once healed a man,
		who has been sick for 38 years,
		and this has been on Sabbath,
		which is also holy to the jews.
		Feel free to read the Bible passage \textit{\href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/JHN.5/John-5}{John 5, 1-18}}.
		You could also say,
		if you want do do something interpersonal to your fellow
		(sorry,
		for not finding a better phrasing),
		then it is no work,
		and thus it is no sin.
		There are also jobs/occupations in the grey area.
		If you work at the police,
		then one could say,
		you work for security.
		But if you \q{have to} wear a weapon,
		I make nothing of this!
		See also \q{\hyperref[VomToeten]{About killing}}.

	\subsubsection{What about on-call duty?}
		Some of this we clarified in the previous subchapter.
		If you work in another job or occupation,
		where no human life is involved when working,
		and you do not only have to work on weekdays,
		then it may really be that you definitively break the Sabbath.
		But I am not here to judge you.
		We have all been given free will by {\God} {\Himself}.
		Therefore decide for yourself,
		whether you think it is right,
		or not.
		
	\subsubsection{What is now considered work?}
		In theory,
		one can also consider everyday household chores,
		such as washing dishes or doing laundry,
		as work.
		That means,
		these things can certainly be done during the week as well.
		In the end,
		you still have to reconcile it with your conscience,
		what you do,
		and what you do not.

	\subsection{About killing} \label{VomToeten}
		Here,
		I would like to go into actual,
		physical killing,
		so not into metaphorical sense,
		like {\Jesus} described it
		\textit{(see \href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/MAT.5/Matthew-5}{Matthew 5, 21-26})}.
		The topic can be very sensitive and difficult,
		and there is also no simple black-and-white scheme here,
		in the sense of \q{Killing is always wrong}.
		I just want to raise awareness here,
		and express my own opinion on the matter.

	\subsubsection{Killing fellow human beings}
		Well,
		let us start small.
		You might possibly want to tell me something like,
		\q{I do not kill.
		I have never killed.
		And I am not a murderer!}
		And for the majority of people,
		that is probably true.
		Most people do not just go out,
		and randomly kill anyone who crosses their path.
		And I am fundamentally against killing.
		I want to live myself,
		and therefore,
		I do not want to be killed.
		And I also say that every fellow human being has the right,
		whether legally,
		morally,
		or however you see it,
		to live.
		Even if you do not like or sympathize with everyone,
		there should be enough love and respect,
		to allow others to live.
		And I think that no one - initially - has the right,
		to decide over the life or non-life of another person.
		\\
		No authority either!
		That is why I also consider wars to be wrong.
		The bigger problem is also that those,
		who want war,
		do not actively participate by going to the front themselves.
		In other words,
		I mean corresponding politicians,
		presidents,
		formerly the kings,
		and whatever they are all called.
		Instead of bashing each other's heads in,
		they send soldiers to war.
		\\
		But also soldiers who actively fight on the front,
		and kill other people are,
		in my eyes,
		murderers.
		There are voices claiming that soldiers have no choice;
		they simply follow \q{commands} or \q{orders}.
		Yes,
		they do have a choice!
		If someone orders me to kill another person,
		I can say \q{No!} at any time.
		Or I can say from the outset that I will not go to the military,
		or at least I will not take a weapon into my hand.
		\\
		I also consider the death penalty to be wrong.
		If I punish a murderer by killing him,
		am I better than him?
		Sure,
		one should show a murderer that his actions have consequences.
		But who am I to decide,
		whether he should live or die?
		I believe only one has this right,
		and that is {\God} {\Himself}.
		And if the time comes,
		{\He} will take us to {\Himself}.
		
	\subsubsection{A special case}
		In this section,
		it gets a bit more difficult.
		Because here,
		I have difficulty forming a concrete opinion myself.
		There are few,
		but really very few cases,
		where it might be possible that,
		for example,
		another person \q{must} decide on the life or death of another person.
		In the previous section I said that only {\God} has the right,
		to decide on life and death.
		That means,
		I might contradict myself,
		now.
		A scenario I could imagine,
		going in this direction,
		would be,
		if someone is in a coma in the hospital,
		and not just for a week,
		but maybe for many months,
		perhaps even a few years.
		And the person is only kept alive with the help of machines.
		And the doctors see little chance that the person will ever wake up again.
		And,
		with all due respect for life and fellow human beings,
		lying in the hospital costs money.
		And in this case,
		the relatives would probably take over the costs,
		if they do not have good insurance.
		Or it could also be that the insurance stops paying at some point,
		and the costs are difficult for the relatives to bear in the long run.
		What if the doctors cannot bring this person out of the coma anymore?
		Should one just turn off the machines,
		and the person dies?
		What if,
		despite low chances,
		the person would still have come back?
		Many questions can be asked here,
		and there can be many possibilities with many variations.
		If I had a few wishes,
		one of them surely would be that in my life,
		it will never be the case that I am faced with this choice,
		of whether someone should live or die.
		
	\subsubsection{The trolley problem}
		Another scenario is the so-called \q{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem}{Trolley problem}},
		a thought experiment,
		simplified,
		where a train is heading towards a group of,
		for example,
		five people,
		who are unaware of it.
		And on another track,
		there is also one person,
		who is also unaware of the whole situation.
		And by adjusting the switches,
		there is the opportunity for the train to take the other track,
		and instead,
		the individual person dies.
		The decision then is,
		do you let five people die,
		or one single person,
		because that would be four less?
		
	\subsubsection{Other forms of active killing}
		But in our \q{everyday life},
		we do not constantly kill our fellow human beings.
		There are also other forms of killing that one might not consciously perceive as such.
		What do you do when,
		for example,
		a fly or a spider,
		or something similar,
		is near you?
		Let us say at your home?
		Do you find insects and other creepy-crawlies annoying,
		or do you even find them disgusting?
		Or are you perhaps afraid of them,
		e.g. bees or wasps,
		because you have been stung before?
		How do you deal with it?
		Would you try to kill them to avoid getting stung yourself?
		Or if you find them just gross or annoying,
		would you also want to kill them just to get rid of them?
		But on the other hand,
		are they not also living beings,
		and thus creatures of {\God}?
		Do they also not have the right to live?
		Yes, in \href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/GEN.1/Genesis-1}{Genesis 1:26},
		it says, 
		\q{Then {\God} said:
		Let {\Us} make man in {\Our} image,
		after {\Our} likeness.
		And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
		and over the birds of the heavens,
		and over the livestock,
		and over all the earth,
		and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.}
		But \q{dominion} does not mean \q{killing}.
		I myself,
		too,
		feel fear or disgust towards some insects,
		and spiders are repulsive to me.
		In the past,
		I would have killed every spider without a second thought,
		or had my wife do it,
		just to get rid of it.
		But lately,
		I try to overcome myself more often and bring them out of my home.
		Since I do not want to touch the spider,
		I take a large drinking glass and a firm,
		thin surface,
		such as a thin piece of cardboard.
		I carefully place the glass over the spider to trap it.
		Once it has crawled onto the bottom of the glass,
		I gently slide the cardboard under the glass and transport the whole thing outside.
		I then place everything on the ground,
		put the glass down,
		step aside,
		and wait for the spider to crawl out.
		Then I take the glass and cardboard back,
		returning to my home.
		This way,
		I get rid of a spider without killing it.
		Or would you want to be killed \q{just},
		because you are bothering someone?

	\subsubsection{Passive killing}
		Now it gets even more delicate.
		There are two types of passive killing here,
		and I am not talking about fellow human beings,
		but other living beings.
		The first relates to nutrition.
		And yes,
		I also enjoy eating meat in any form,
		such as cold cuts,
		sausages,
		ground meat,
		occasional burgers,
		steaks,
		poultry,
		or fish,
		and whatever else is available.
		I do not want to be a \q{moralizer},
		but effectively,
		for me to eat my meat (whatever kind),
		an animal like a cow,
		pig,
		chicken,
		or fish had to die for it.
		Unfortunately,
		this is also the case throughout nature;
		one living being survives only by feeding on another living being,
		in extreme cases by killing it.
		However,
		I do not want to live a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle;
		I enjoy the taste of meat and meat products too much.
		I have tried alternative products,
		and they often have a strange aftertaste for me.
		I also do not like the taste of milk substitutes.
		But everyone has different preferences.
		It is not about me telling you,
		what you should or should not eat.
		I just want to make you aware - and myself as well - that constant killing also takes place in everyday life.
		
	\subsubsection{Other forms of killing}
		The second one looks like this:
		Imagine you suddenly get sick,
		like catching a cold or something similar.
		What happens here biologically?
		Well,
		you have caught pathogens,
		possibly bacteria.
		And to get healthy again,
		you may need medication to fight the pathogens.
		But even your body,
		your immune system,
		is already fighting against the pathogens.
		What is called (disease) symptoms,
		is the body's reaction to the pathogens.
		Effectively,
		your immune system wants to kill them.
		And there is nothing you can actively do about it.
		So,
		in a sense,
		these bacteria must die for you not to die from the illness.

	\subsubsection{Summary}
		Of course,
		I cannot cover all forms of killing;
		there might be too many,
		and the whole topic is too complex.
		I just wanted to show you with the above,
		how complex the subject of killing is,
		when you think about it.
		I am not claiming that you are a murderer consciously killing other beings.
		I do not even know you.
		I just want to share some thoughts with you,
		and strengthen your awareness.
		May {\God} be with you.

	\subsection{About adultery}
		If you are currently single,
		or engaged in open and transparent relationships,
		where your partners are aware and comfortable with it,
		you may not necessarily need to read this subchapter.
		However,
		you are still welcome to continue reading,
		if it interests you.

	\subsubsection{Are you in a relationship?}
		Are you married,
		or in a committed (romantic) relationship?
		If so,
		congratulations,
		and I hope you find yourself in a healthy relationship.
		Marriage is a significant responsibility,
		and not something to be discarded like stale bread,
		as if you could always buy a new one.
		Marriage should be holy to you,
		regardless of your beliefs or non-beliefs.
		Even if you are in a non-marital commitment with someone,
		your partner deserves to feel loved and valued.
		For simplicity,
		I will refer to marriage,
		but the following discussions apply equally,
		if you are in a committed relationship without marriage.

	\subsubsection{How is your relationship?}
		Before delving into the topic,
		I would like to ask,
		how is your relationship?
		If you generally have a healthy,
		happy relationship,
		feel free to skip the next section.

	\subsubsection{Why did you stay?}
		Are there difficulties in your relationship?
		And I am not talking about the small everyday things,
		like who does the dishes or takes out the trash.
		I mean really serious problems.
		Of course,
		I am not a marriage counselor or relationship coach.
		But think first:
		Where do the problems come from?
		You can always have what is commonly called a \q{toxic} partner.
		But please,
		take a closer look at your relationship,
		and be honest with yourself.
		Do your problems perhaps stem from mutual issues?
		Because just as a relationship is a constant give-and-take,
		in difficulties,
		there is never only one guilty one;
		it always takes both.
		Then see,
		what you can do to approach your partner,
		so that together you can get your relationship back on track.
		Feel free to seek couples counseling.
		Only if everything else fails,
		and nothing works,
		it might be better for both of you,
		to part ways to avoid further suffering.
		But that should really be the last resort for your relationship.
		\\
		But now,
		I have not answered one question yet:
		Is that adultery?
		Well,
		technically speaking,
		it is!
		That is,
		what the meaning of the word is.
		Through the separation,
		for example through a divorce,
		the relationship \q{marriage} is broken apart.
		After all,
		{\God} brought you both together.
		However,
		I am not here to point fingers and judge you.
		As I said,
		if it is the last resort,
		because really nothing is working,
		then it might be better to part ways.
		Besides,
		you cannot force anyone to love you.
		And no one will ever be able to force you to love them.
		And fundamentally,
		everyone has the human right to be loved,
		and to be happy.

	\subsubsection{So, what about adultery?}
		The simplest form,
		which should be familiar to everyone,
		is simply and plainly cheating.
		So,
		if you go to bed with someone other than your (marital) partner.
		And I believe you and I,
		both of us,
		are mature and sensible enough to understand what I mean.
		\\
		What is,
		if you look after another woman,
		or another man,
		in a \q{lusting} manner?
		Maybe the thought might sneak in,
		how nice it would be,
		to do certain things with that person.
		Even if it should only be for one night.
		Because if I covet another person than my wife,
		then why am I in a relationship with her anyway,
		and not with that other person?
		Is that valuable?
		How would you feel?
		Just imagine,
		you and your partner,
		you both are going for a walk.
		And then another good-looking person is eappering,
		is passing by,
		and your partner is looking after this person.
		How would that feel like for you?
		Just let this thought take a short effect on you,
		and be totally honest with yourself.
		I do think that this is adultery.
		As I said,
		imagine that siuation,
		and imagine,
		if you would do that,
		und then think about,
		why are you in the relationship with your partner,
		if you covet or desire someone else?
		The Bible,
		or better {\Jesus} to be precise,
		has got a very clear opinion on this.
		You can read it in \href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/MAT.5/Matthew-5}{Matthew 5, 27-32}:
		\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,start=27]
			\item	You have heard that it was said:
					\q{You shall not commit adultery.}
			\item	But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman,
					with lustful intent,
					has already committed adultery with her,
					in his heart.
			\item	If your right eye causes you to sin,
					tear it out and throw it away.
					For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
			\item	And if your right hand causes you to sin,
					cut it off and throw it away.
					For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.
			\item	It was also said:
					\q{Whoever divorces his wife,
					let him give her a certificate of divorce.}
			\item	But I say to you that everyone,
					who divorces his wife,
					except on the ground of sexual immorality,
					makes her commit adultery,
					and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\subsubsection{A specific topic for adults}
		Do you watch \q{(special) adult movies}?
		And to be completely specific,
		what is your opinion about pornography?
		Why do you watch that?
		I know,
		it maybe can be a kind of grey area,
		if you both,
		you and your partner,
		watch those films together,
		e.g. for your lovemaking.
		And that is not even my concern.
		But,
		do you watch them secretly alone?
		Why?
		Is your partner not desirable enough?
		Do you find the men or women in those film more desirable?
		Why don't you go then to them?!
		No,
		seriously ...
		you do love your partner, don't you?
		Why do you want to hurt him (or her),
		or possibly risk that one day he (or she) will catch you watching,
		and then it will have bad consequences for your relationship?
		
	\subsubsection{Is masturbation adultery?}
		I hope,
		we both are mature enough,
		to look at this topic seriously.
		First things first:
		{\God} did give us sexual drive,
		not in vain,
		but that we multiply;
		that is what it says in \href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/GEN.1/Genesis-1}{Genesis 1, 28}:
		\q{And {\God} blessed them.
		And {\God} said to them:
		Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, [...]}
		\\
		I will not tell any horror stories either,
		like,
		it was unhealthy,
		would make you blind,
		or lead to spinal cord atrophy.
		If you are still exploring your body,
		or you are currently single,
		and want to reduce \q{pressure},
		then feel free to do it,
		if your belief allows it.
		\\
		But is it adultery in a marriage?
		This is hard to say.
		This is a greay area, too.
		I do not want to make you afraid or worried either,
		on thinking that you maybe would be a bad person,
		if you touch yourself on the \q{wrong} place.
		It depends on,
		why you do it.
		If you both cannot see each other for some reasons at the moment,
		because e.g. you are on a business trip,
		then it may be okay,
		just to not to succumb to temptation,
		to commit adultery with someone else.
		Or perhaps your partner is not capable at the moment due to other reasons.
		Or maybe you even incorporate it into your lovemaking.
		So,
		there are many options,
		where you can say,
		it is not adultery.
		But it could be adultery,
		if it only serves you to just get satisfaction on your own,
		and with that you neglet your partner,
		and so your relationship.
		It possible can help,
		if you talk open with your partner about it.
		
	\subsubsection{Summary}
		There might be more forms of adultery that are not currently apparent,
		or coming to my mind.
		One form I can still share with you:
		It is also considered adultery when you destroy another relationship,
		for instance,
		by having an affair with one of the individuals involved.
		Adultery is not limited to one's own relationship;
		it encompasses all (romantic) relationships.
		Love is sacred,
		and thus,
		relationships outside of one's own should be respected,
		and treated as off-limits.
		\\
		Overall,
		it might not be possible to draw a 100\% clear line in every situation,
		which potentially smells like adultery.
		In cases of doubt,
		listen to yourself,
		follow your heart,
		heed your conscience,
		be honest with yourself and others,
		and seek forgiveness from them and from {\God}!

	\subsection{About cursing and swearing}
		In order to delve deeper into this topic,
		I would like to quote the Bible passage \href{https://www.die-bibel.de/bibeln/online-bibeln/lesen/ESV/MAT.5/Matthew-5}{Matthew 5, 33-37}:
		\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,start=33]
			\item	Again you have heard that it was said to those of old,
					\q{You shall not swear falsely,
					but shall perform to the {\Lord},
					what you have sworn.}
			\item	But I say to you,
					Do not take an oath at all,
					either by {\Heaven},
					for it is the throne of {\God},
			\item	or by the earth,
					for it is {\His} footstool,
					or by Jerusalem,
					for it is the city of the Great King.
			\item	And do not take an oath by your head,
					for you cannot make one hair white or black.
			\item	Let what you say be simply \q{Yes} or \q{No};
					anything more than this comes from evil.
		\end{enumerate}
		Let us take a closer look at this now!

	\subsubsection{Swearing and summoning}
		I guess,
		with \q{swearing} not only literal \q{swearing} is meant,
		like one shall take an oath in court,
		as you may possibly know from films or movies.
		Unfortunately,
		I do not know,
		how it is like in an actual trial.
		Because the only time,
		I have been to court,
		was on a class outing,
		and we were just a part of the audience.
		And additionally,
		I do not remember any details,
		because back then I was a teenager.
		\\
		If you look at different languages,
		and thus different translations for this word,
		perhaps the whole thing can also be interpreted,
		as it is meant as a kind of magic,
		oder summoning e.g. ghosts or demons.
		Because that would explain,
		why {\Jesus} said:
		\q{[...],
		for you cannot make one hair white or black.}
		So that should give you the general sense of not having power of the supernatural,
		and you also shall not have it.
		You also shall keep away from any ghosts or demons,
		especially the devil himself,
		because they just will test you.
		And you also cannot perform magic,
		and thus you cannot redye hair in a magical manner.
		And wenn I say \q{magic},
		I do not talk about magic on TV or in movies,
		or some card tricks.
		I myself find them entertainging sometimes, too.
		And if someone is good in his performance,
		then it does have something kind of \q{magical}.
		And it is also totally okay,
		if you like watching movies where e.g. magicians occur.
		And with \q{redying hair} I do not talk about by means of modern hair dye products,
		but really \q{as if by magic}.

	\subsubsection{Cursing and damning}
		Let us now look at cursing,
		because topically it is based on swaring.
		Because \q{swearing} cannot only be understood as \q{taking an oath},
		but also \q{cursing} (or \q{cussing})
		like \q{using swear words},
		or even as \q{damning}.
		And when I jump ahead to damning,
		we are back again at the same point,
		as swearing or summoning.
		Do not get involved into above-mentioned magic or witchcraft,
		and do not ally with demons or somewhom.
		That can and will have severe consequences.
		And I am not even talking about your relationship to {\God},
		and that should not be neglected either.
		You do not own supernatural powers,
		so do not touch them!
		\\
		But,
		let us go back one step,
		and let us just take a look onto cursing.
		On the one hand,
		the meaning can be that you should not use (filthy) swear words.
		You surely can express your frustration with less coarse words as well.
		But then you could talk to me like:
		\q{Look who's talking!}
		Because my language is not perfect either.
		The main concern is that you do not utter the the {\Lords} name,
		or other bad expressions like \textit{\q{Holy sh...}}.
		This does not only go below your waistline,
		but also far abvove your head.
		Simultaneously you violate another one of {\Gods} commandments that you shall not take {\His} name in vain.

	\subsubsection{Summary}
		In short I can say,
		when you are going to \q{swear} in the future,
		then do not let your oath be empty words.
		Look at it as a promise that you are going to keep,
		or that you are going to tell the truth.
		Maybe it will also help you,
		if you talk about past events,
		instead of saying \q{I swear that I have done this.},
		you just say \q{I (really) have done this.}
		Because if you and your statement are trustworthy,
		you do not have to swear or anything else!
		And for future events instead of \q{I swear that I will do this.},
		you rather say \q{I promise that I will do this.}
		And then,
		of course,
		it is important that you keep,
		whether you make a pledge to {\God} or {\Jesus},
		or also to your fellow beings.

	\newpage
	\section{Prayers, Hymns and Alleluiahs}
		In this chapter I would like to offer you some beautiful prayers,
		often presented in the form \q{I am talking to {\God}},
		and hymns and alleluiahs.

	\subsection{The {\Lords} Prayer}
		As already mentioned with the 10 commandments,
		I do not refuse the {\Lords} Prayer,
		as it is written down in the Bible.
		Here,
		I also want to show you a more personal form,
		which is also less \q{commanding}.
		In my opinion,
		the {\Lords} Prayer contains too much imperatives.
		Instead of praying \q{hallowed be {\Thy} name},
		or \q{hallowed by {\Your} name},
		it is better to say \q{{\Thy} name is hallowed},
		or \q{{\Thy} name is holy}.
		Or instead of \q{{\Thy} will be done},
		or \q{{\Your} will be done},
		better say \q{{\Thy} will happens},
		because {\God} exists,
		and in my opinion,
		in doublt,
		exactly what {\God} wants will happen,
		also if we do not recognize immediately,
		or more we do not unserstand immediately.

	\subsubsection{If you are praying alone}
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
			\item	My {\Father} in {\Heaven},
					\\
					{\Thy} name is hallowed \textit{(holy)}.
			\item	{\Thy} Kingdom will come.
			\item	{\Thine} will happen,
					\\
					on Earth,
					as it is in {\Heaven}.
			\item	{\Thou} givest me my daily bread,
					today.
			\item	Please,
					forgive me my sins,
					\\
					and I also forgive those who sin against me.
			\item	{\Thou} leadest me not in temptation,
					\\
					but {\Thou} deliverst me from evil.
			\item	For {\Thine} is the Kingdom,
					\\
					and the power,
					\\
					and the glory,
					\\
					now and forever.
			\item	Amen!
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{If you are praying in a group}
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
			\item	Our {\Father} in {\Heaven},
					\\
					{\Thy} name is hallowed \textit{(holy)}.
			\item	{\Thy} Kingdom will come.
			\item	{\Thine} will happen,
					\\
					on Earth,
					as it is in {\Heaven}.
			\item	{\Thou} givest us our daily bread,
					today.
			\item	Please,
					forgive us our sins,
					\\
					and we also forgive those who sin against us.
			\item	{\Thou} leadest us not in temptation,
					\\
					but {\Thou} deliverst us from evil.
			\item	For {\Thine} is the Kingdom,
					\\
					and the power,
					\\
					and the glory,
					\\
					now and forever.
			\item	Amen!
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{If you want to use modern English}
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
			\item	My {\Father} in {\Heaven},
					\\
					{\Your} name is holy.
			\item	{\Your} Kingdom comes.
			\item	{{\Yours} will happen},
					\\
					on Earth,
					as it is in {\Heaven}.
			\item	{\You} give me my daily bread,
					today.
			\item	Please,
					forgive me my sins,
					\\
					and I also forgive those who sin against me.
			\item	{\You} do not lead me in temptation,
					\\
					but {\You} deliver me from evil.
			\item	For {\Yours} is the Kingdom,
					\\
					and the power,
					\\
					and the glory,
					\\
					now and forever.
			\item	Amen!
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{{\Jesus}, come into my life (Surrender Prayer \#1)}
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
			\item	{\Jesus},
					I would like {\You} to come into my life.
			\item	{\Jesus},
					I am opening my \textit{(heart's)} door.
					\\
					I am opening my heart to {\You}.
			\item	{\Jesus},
					I would like my life to be led by {\You},
					\\
					and that {\You} take the leadership of my life.
			\item	{\Jesus},

					and I believe that {\You} are the way,

					the truth and life.
			\item	{\Jesus},
					I hand over my life to {\You}.
			\item	Amen!
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Surrender Prayer \#2}
			\begin{itemize}[nosep]
				\item	{\Jesus},
						I just want to understand,
						who {\You} are.
				\item	And {\Jesus},
						I want to surrender my life to {\You} now.
				\item	Maybe I do not understand what it means;
						\\
						and maybe I do not understand,

				\item	Maybe I do not understand who {\You} are,
						\\
						what my mission is,
						what my purpose is in this world.
				\item	And {\Jesus},

						all the doubts,
						and everything that still separates me from {\You}.

						living water within me,
						coming from {\You};
				\item	and {\Jesus},
						that {\You} free me from chains,
						\\
						from which I cannot get out right now,

						and grant me {\Your} peace.
				\item	And take my life into {\Your} hands,

						whiter than snow.
				\item	From now on {\You} shall be my {\Lord}.
				\item	And I am {\Your} child.
				\item	And I will live with {\You} for eternity.

	\subsection{Miracle Prayer}
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
			\item	Loving {\Father},
					help me to cultivate spiritual disciplines,
					so that I may better receive,
					what {\You} have to say to me,
					and be more willing to do what {\You} require.
			\item	May I not only come to {\You} with my needs,
					my praises,
					and my thanksgivings,
					but may I make a habit of spending time in worshipful listening.
			\item	Help me not to let the distractions of social media,
					and the busyness of life drown out {\Your} still small voice.
			\item	Help me to let {\You} guide me in all things,
					rather than my own imperfect judgment.
			\item	Let {\Your} {\Spirit} speak words of wisdom,
					and guidance over my life today.
			\item	{\You} have promised a Comforter,
					who will be with me every step of the way,
					to guide me and provide,
					what I need.
			\item	Be with me,
					{\Father}.
			\item	Help me to speak the right words,

			\item	Help me determine,
					which direction opens the right doors,
					and allows productive relationships to flourish.
			\item	Amen!
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{The Creed of Belief}
		The Creed of Belief is adopted nearly 1-by-1.
		The only missing part is the church-part,
		because a Free Christian is not bound to a chruch community.
		\\
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
			\item	I believe in {\God},
					\\
					the {\Father},
					the {\Allmighty},
					\\
					the {\Creator} of {\Heaven} and Earth.
			\item	I believe in {\Jesus} {\Christ},
					\\
					{\His} only {\Son},
					my {\Lord};
					\\
					he was conceived by the {\Holy} {\Spirit},
					\\
					and born by the virgin Mary;
					\\
					{\He} suffered under Pontius Pilate;
					\\		
					{\He} was crucified, {\He} died and was buried,
					\\
					and descended to the Realm of Death;
					\\
					on the Third Day {\He} rose again,
					\\
					{\He} ascended into {\Heaven};
					\\
					{\He} is seated to the right hand of the {\Father};
					\\
					{\He} will come again,
					\\
					to judge the living and the dead.
			\item	I believe in the {\Holy} {\Spirit},
					\\
					the forgiveness of sins,
					\\
					the resurrection of the body,
					\\
					and in everlasting life.
			\item	Amen!

	\section{My life with {\God}} \label{MeinLebenMitGott}
		This chapter is a kind of irregular \q{diary} in the broadest sense,
		how I experience my journey with and to {\God},
		and all the things a may learn on it.
	
	\subsection{Wednesday, September 27th, 2023}
		I have been on a kind of journey since mid-2023,
		on which I decided to let {\God} and {\Jesus} in my life.
		I still do have a lot of flaws,
		and despite of the {\God} given commandments \textit{(offers)},
		I sin much too often.
		As mentioned in the preface,
		I am still far,
		far away of being a kind of \q{perfect Christian}.
		Many of my everyday habits,
		of my character and other stuff,
		they have such a strong pulling effect
		that often I do not think of {\God},
		and I do not pray,
		and read the Bible,
		as often as I would like to.
		And whenever {\God} comes \q{back again} into my thinking,
		I often have a guilty conscience,
		because for me it feels like I have \q{forgotten} {\Him}.
		So,
		long story short:
		I may still learn a lot and way too much!

	\subsection{Friday, September 29th, 2023}
		Today I watched a video that gave me a lot to think about.
		I do not know,
		whether it is blasphemy.
		Still,
		I want to share with you,
		what I saw in it.
		It was basically a short animation,
		in which a Muslim,
		an atheist and a Christian went to {\Heaven}.
		Since you haven't really seen {\God} {\Himself} here,
		but just a caricature,
		I will use normal capitalization here.
		So it was all about,
		which statements God feels insulted and offended by.
		And in the end he gave the atheist his peace,
		and actually sent him to heaven,
		because he never believed in God,
		and neither said one thing nor the other about him.
		And he, God, was disappointed in the Muslim and in the Christian,
		because they basically represented him as such an \q{evil} God,
		as if he would simply throw all people into hell,
		who sin and do not believe in him.
		That hurt him very much,
		because he effectively felt like a cruel monster.
		This so far is the short version.
		And that got me thinking.
		Of course,
		I can only speculate.
		But maybe it is like that,
		that {\God} is not \q{sending} us anywhere.
		If we choose {\Him},
		{\He} invites us to stay in Heaven after death.
		And if we choose, for example, the devil,
		then it truely may be,
		that we will go to hell.
		But not because {\God} sends us there,
		but because the devil takes us away.
		Like I said ... I do not know.
		This video just made me think.
		And probably,
		it may often be the case,
		that one might say this or that about {\God},
		but he or she actually does not know,
		what is the real truth.
		But what you can do at least,
		is to think about it first,
		when you say something about {\God},
		whether you would want to be told similar things about yourself.
		If you would like to make your own judgment about the video,
		here is the link: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttevamkS6gw}.

	\subsection{Tuesday, October 3rd, 2023}
		Last weekend,
		until inclusive yesterday,
		I have been to Hamburg with my wife and my parents.
		But for some reason,
		starting on Sunday,
		I did not feel so well during the day.
		I was,
		among other things,
		overtired,
		and tormented by headaches.
		And I assume,
		my lack of motion or exercise also became apparent here,
		because I experienced every staircase as torture.
		At least I could read in my Bible app in the morning,
		what was already worth a lot to me.
		In the meantime I had a suspicion,
		where my headache may have come from.
		But I have no proof for it,
		so it will just stay an assumption.
		Anyway,
		since I wanted to go through the Sabbath this time,
		I stayed abstinent from coffee and potentially sugar-containing foods.
		My wife often suggested that I should drink a cup of coffee,
		but I did not want to fall for this trial.
		And I also heard once that sugar can be addictive.
		And thus it belongs to the things,
		I want to be abstinent from.
		I also heard once that one withdrawal symptom,
		e.g. with a sugar \q{addiction},
		can be headache.
		And when that is the case,
		then I sin really often outside of Sabbath for that matter.
		See also: \q{\hyperref[TheTenthOffer]{The Tenth Offer}}.

	\subsection{Saturday, October 7th, 2023}
		I am slowly getting the feeling that it is getting serious.
		Of course,
		in a positive sense.
		Because of this,
		I spontaneously decided today to prepare the GitHub discussion
		(mentioned in the preface)
		for you,
		and release this work as a monthly edition.
		The first one is the October edition,
		which I published earlier.
		The November edition should then be released promptly at the turn of the month,
		planned on November 1st.
				
	\subsection{Sunday, October 8th, 2023}
		Unfortunately,
		I caught a cold after the weekend in Hamburg.
		Nevertheless,
		I still want to share a beautiful Bible passage with you today.
		It is Romans 10,
		verses 5 to 11,
		with the heading
		\q{Salvation is available to all}
		from the German \q{Neues Leben Bibel} \textit{(New Life Bible)},
		translated into English.
		Enjoy reading.
		\begin{enumerate}[nosep,start=5]
			\item	For Moses writes that the law’s way of making a person right with {\God} requires obedience to all of its commands.
			\item	But faith’s way of getting right with {\God} says,
					do not say in your heart,
					\q{Who will go up to heaven?},
					to bring {\Christ} down to earth.
			\item	And do not say,
					\q{Who will go down to the place of the dead?},
					to bring {\Christ} back to life again.
			\item	In fact,
					it says,
					\q{The message is very close at hand;
					it is on your lips and in your heart.}
					And that message is the very message about faith that we preach.
			\item	If you openly declare that {\Jesus} is the {\Lord},
					and believe in your heart that {\God} raised {\Him} from the dead,
					you will be saved.
			\item	For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with {\God},
					and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved.
			\item	As the scriptures tell us,
					\q{Anyone who trusts in {\Him} will never be disgraced.}
		\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Sunday, Oktober 22nd, 2023}
		The past week was overall a bit strange.
		At the beginning of the week,
		it already felt freezing outside.
		I noticed this throughout the week because,
		around Wednesday,
		the battery of my e-scooter was only half full,
		and I had charged it just the Friday before.
		Usually,
		one charge lasts me about two weeks for commuting to work and back home.
		Strangely,
		temperatures rose again from Wednesday onwards.
		Then,
		I overslept a few times and,
		as a result,
		arrived a few minutes late to work.
		Fortunately,
		I have not-so-strict bosses.
		But when I come in later,
		I can also leave later,
		as I still want to complete my eight working hours.
		I prayed to {\Jesus} for the weekend to compensate somewhat for this.
		In a way,
		I did the opposite of the saying \q{Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.}
		Instead,
		it is like \q{Do not curse the day before it is over.},
		and I extended that to the entire week.
		I hope that the following week goes a bit better.
				
	\subsection{Friday, October 27th, 2023}
		Last night I prayed to {\God},
		and I also spoke a surrender prayer to {\Jesus}.
		And to show {\Him} that I am serious about it,
		I also got rid of a few things.
		I do not want to go into detail now,
		because on the one hand,
		it is very private,
		and on the other hand,
		I do not want to come across as some kind of \q{proletarian}.
		I just wanted to share the current state of things with you,
		so that you can get something out of my life every now and then,
		and my journey with {\God}.
		
	\subsection{Sunday, October 29th, 2023}
		Yesterday I thought of an extremely blatant story,
		which is possibly quite pretentious,
		but it would still be so cool,
		if {\God} happened to pursue exactly this plan.
		Of course,
		it is just speculation,
		and under no circumstances do I want to say anything blasphemous.
		But if you are interested,
		I would still like to share the story with you.
		\\
		So,
		we know that people have been around for a very long time.
		And human history,
		from the time,
		where you can say
		that people have become sedentary,
		dates back around 10,000 to 12,000 BC.
		Roughly.
		That means,
		just in terms of human history,
		up to the present day,
		what we refer to as the Middle Ages is not actually the real \q{Middle Ages}.
		But that is just by the way.
		And the day will come
		which we often call the Judgment Day,
		or the Apocalypse,
		on which we are to justify ourselves.
		Because then the {\Lord} will return to earth.
		And it would be really cool,
		if {\God} sent us {\His} only begotten {\Son} right in the middle of human history,
		around the time when {\Jesus} lived,
		to forgive all our sins,
		and give us the chance to confess to {\God} and {\Jesus}.
		And we are currently in the second half of human history.
		That means,
		as a humanity,
		we have a limited timeframe of about 20,000 to 24,000 years
		(perhaps a bit more).
		However,
		this also means that in approximately 8,000 to 10,000 years,
		the Day of Judgment will come.
		So,
		a short period before {\Jesus},
		and a short period after {\Jesus} would be the real \q{Middle Ages},
		and before that was the real \q{Ancient Times},
		and after that is also the real \q{Modern Era}.
		I do not want to be too precise about the timeline.
		And when I think about the people in the time we call the Middle Ages,
		possibly considering them ignorant and primitive,
		and even today,
		we still engage in conflicts and wars,
		it raises the question:
		Are we,
		as humanity as a whole,
		so much different than we were about 1,000 years ago?
		Sure,
		technologies have changed,
		we live in the Digital Age with machines,
		computers and smartphones.
		Artificial intelligence is also currently developing.
		\\
		As I said,
		this is just a story that suddenly came to my mind,
		and somehow makes sense.
		Feel free to think about this story.
		It would be too interesting to know,
		how you think about it.
		Of course it can also be the case that I am totally wrong,
		and {\God} gives humanity as much time as we want.
		And that means,
		of course,
		we are completely responsible for not wiping ourselves out.
		Because that is why {\He} gave us free will.
